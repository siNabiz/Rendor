Real-time rendering features to learn

Here, I am planning to make small features related to Real-time Rendering. I am planning to clean up the code in the near future and continue building on the features.

I have used the basic game loop template from DirectXTK.
Direct3d win32 game template provides game loop, dealing with Win32 windows events and management of the DirectX 11 device.
DirectXTK provides controller input, math library and texture file management.
