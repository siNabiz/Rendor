Real-time rendering features to learn

Here, I am planning to make small features related to Real-time Rendering.

I have used the basic game loop template from DirectXTK.
Direct3d win32 game template
    provides game loop, dealing with win32 windows events and management of the directx 11 device.
directxtk
    provides controller input, math library and texture file management.
